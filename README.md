# Image-Classification
In this Python notebook, I present and discuss a mini-project focused on developing, training, and testing a Convolutional Neural Network model to identify the presence of sunglasses in face images.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's CMU Face Images dataset, available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/CMU+Face+Images.
The dataset consists of samples organized into two folders, corresponding to the two classes:
sunglasses and without sunglasses (NoSunglasses).

The main objective of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, leveraging various concepts such as train/validation/test split, grid-search for hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and more.
